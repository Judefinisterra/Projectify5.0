### SaaS Business Model

I acquire 100 new customers per month at $200 per customer acquisition cost.
```

### E-commerce Business

I sell widgets online for $25 each with $10 cost of goods sold.
I sell 500 units per month and expect 20% monthly growth.
I have $5,000 monthly marketing expenses and $2,000 monthly overhead.

## Tips for Success

### Writing Good Prompts
‚úÖ **Good**: "I sell 100 units at $10 each with 20% margins"
‚ùå **Avoid**: "I have a business that makes money"

### Include These Details:
- **Volume**: How many units/customers/transactions
- **Pricing**: Price per unit or subscription fee
- **Costs**: Direct costs, employee costs, overhead
- **Growth**: Expected growth rates or trends
- **Timing**: When expenses occur (monthly, annually)

### Common Patterns:
- **Unit √ó Price = Revenue**
- **Revenue √ó Margin % = Gross Profit**
- **# Employees √ó Salary = Payroll Cost**
