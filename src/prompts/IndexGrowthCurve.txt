The INDEX system is used when modeling unit economics that scale over time based on volume, where each unit follows a lifecycle pattern based on its age rather than calendar dates. This is common for businesses like restaurants, retail stores, subscription cohorts, or any asset that has a maturation curve.

## WHEN TO USE INDEX SYSTEM

Use INDEX when the client describes:
- Opening/launching units over time (restaurants, stores, franchises, etc.)
- Each unit having a performance curve based on its age/maturity
- Scaling unit economics across a volume driver
- Cohort-based revenue/cost patterns
- Assets that mature or ramp up over their lifetime

Examples that trigger INDEX usage:
- "I will open 1 restaurant in January, 2 in March, then 5 per year. Each restaurant generates $1000 in month 1, $2000 in month 2, then $10,000 monthly thereafter."
- "We'll launch new stores quarterly. Each store loses money for 6 months, then becomes profitable."
- "New subscription cohorts have different retention curves based on how long they've been customers."

## INDEX SYSTEM STRUCTURE

```
<INDEXBEGIN; driver1="[VolumeDriver]"; row1="..."; row2="Month #"; row3="Year #"; row4="Year end #">
  [Unit economics codes for ONE unit]
<INDEXEND; row2="Aggregate Growth Curve Items:">
```

### Key Components:

1. **INDEXBEGIN Code:**
   - `driver1` parameter MUST reference the volume driver (e.g., "V1" for # of new units)
   - Creates special time series: Month 1, Month 2, etc. (age-based, not calendar dates)
   - Sets up scaling framework

2. **Special Rows in INDEXBEGIN:**
   - `row1`: Contains "INDEXBEGIN" markers and "F" in Y1-Y6 columns for formulas
   - `row2`: "Month #" - represents age of unit (Month 1 = first month of life)
   - `row3`: "Year #" - maps months to years for annual scaling
   - `row4`: "Year end #" - defines year-end periods for calculations

3. **Unit Economics (Between INDEXBEGIN/INDEXEND):**
   - Model performance of ONE unit across its lifecycle
   - Use monthsr parameter for month-by-month patterns
   - Include fincode in column (F) for items that should be aggregated
   - Use sumif="year" or sumif="average" for annual scaling

4. **INDEXEND Code:**
   - Closes the INDEX block
   - Creates aggregate rows that sum across all units and ages

## SCALING LOGIC

The system automatically creates formulas that:
- Track each unit's age in every period
- Apply the appropriate lifecycle value based on unit age
- Aggregate across all units of different ages
- Scale by the volume driver

**Example Calculation:**
- Volume: 1 restaurant opens Jan 2025, 2 open Feb 2025
- Restaurant revenue: $1000 in month 1, $2000 in month 2
- Jan 2025 total: $1000 (1 restaurant × $1000 month-1 revenue)  
- Feb 2025 total: $4000 (1 restaurant × $2000 month-2 revenue + 2 restaurants × $1000 month-1 revenue)

## CORRECT CODE SEQUENCE

1. **Volume Driver Code** (before INDEX):
```
<SPREAD-E; row1="V1(D)|# of New Restaurants Opened(L)|..."; monthsr1="1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1">
```

2. **INDEX Block**:
```
<INDEXBEGIN; driver1="V1"; row1="(D)|Growth Curve of One Restaurant(L)|(F)|INDEXBEGIN(C1)|INDEXBEGIN(C2)|(C3)|(C4)|(C5)|(C6)|F(Y1)|F(Y2)|F(Y3)|F(Y4)|F(Y5)|F(Y6)|"; row2="(D)|~Month #(L)|..."; row3="(D)|~Year #(L)|..."; row4="(D)|~Year end #(L)|...">

<SPREAD-E; sumif="year"; driver1="V1"; row1="V2(D)|Sales(L)|is: revenue(F)|..."; monthsr1="0|0|0|0|0|0|1000|2000|3000|6000|11000|12000">

<INDEXEND; row2="(D)|~Aggregate Growth Curve Items:(L)|...">
```

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **driver1 Parameter**: INDEXBEGIN must reference the volume driver
2. **monthsr Parameter**: Use for lifecycle patterns within INDEX
3. **sumif Parameter**: Required for annual aggregation (usually "year" or "average")
4. **Fincode Column**: Items with fincodes in column (F) get aggregated
5. **Y1-Y6 "F" Values**: Required in INDEXBEGIN row1 for formula generation

## ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS (SELF-CONTAINMENT)

🚨 **CRITICAL RULE**: Codestrings outside of the INDEX block CANNOT reference drivers from items inside the INDEX block. Everything must be self-contained within the INDEX system.

### Why This Matters:
- INDEX items are scaled and aggregated using special formulas
- External references would break the scaling mathematics
- Driver relationships must respect the INDEX boundary

### Examples of Required Self-Containment:

❌ **INCORRECT** - External depreciation referencing INDEX capex:
```
<INDEXBEGIN; driver1="V1">
  <CONST-E; row1="V2(D)|Capex per Restaurant(L)|...">
<INDEXEND>
<FAPPE-S; driver1="V2"; row1="..."> <!-- WRONG: Can't reference V2 from outside INDEX -->
```

✅ **CORRECT** - Both capex and depreciation inside INDEX:
```
<INDEXBEGIN; driver1="V1">
  <CONST-E; row1="V2(D)|Capex per Restaurant(L)|is: capex(F)|...">
  <FAPPE-S; driver1="V2"; row1="V3(D)|Depreciation per Restaurant(L)|is: depreciation(F)|...">
<INDEXEND>
```

### Common Scenarios Requiring Internal Placement:

1. **Capex + Depreciation**: Both must be inside INDEX if capex varies by unit age
2. **Working Capital**: If working capital scales with unit revenue, place inside INDEX
3. **Operating Expenses**: Unit-specific opex should be modeled inside INDEX
4. **Tax Calculations**: If taxes depend on unit-level profits, include inside INDEX
5. **Interest Expense**: If debt is tied to unit-level capex, model inside INDEX

### External Model Integration:

- INDEX items with fincodes automatically aggregate to external model
- External model sees total aggregated values, not individual unit economics
- Use INDEXEND aggregate rows for external model references

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

✓ Volume driver exists before INDEX block
✓ INDEXBEGIN has driver1 parameter pointing to volume driver  
✓ Unit economics use monthsr for lifecycle patterns
✓ Revenue/cost items have fincode in column (F)
✓ sumif parameter present on items that should aggregate annually
✓ INDEXEND properly closes the block
✓ **NO external codestrings reference drivers from inside INDEX**
✓ **ALL related calculations (capex, depreciation, etc.) are inside INDEX**
✓ **INDEX system is completely self-contained**
