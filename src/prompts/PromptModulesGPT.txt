Section labels to choose from and their descriptions (label name is string before the ":" symbol)


- Corporate Overhead: Employee and non-employee related expenses that relate to costs that wouldn't be considered direct costs. 
- MarginCOGS: When a client gives you a margin assumption and you need to use that assumption to back into COGS
- Subscriber table: When you need to calculate a running total of subscribers, adjusting for churn, upgrades, downgrades, etc. Alternatively, when you are calcualting a running total of ARR. 
- Debt: Use when the prompt involves borrowing, lending, debt, loans, mortgages, financing, or any payment obligations. Keywords: loan, debt, borrow, lend, interest, principal, balloon payment, repayment, amortization, financing.
- MonthsR: When the client specifies different values for specific months within a year, month-by-month breakdowns, ramp-up periods with exact monthly figures, or seasonality with specific monthly amounts. Examples: "month 1 will be $X, month 2 will be $Y", "January will be $500, February will be $750", "First quarter ramp-up: Jan $100, Feb $200, Mar $300".
- IndexGrowthCurve: When modeling unit economics that scale over time based on volume, where each unit follows a lifecycle pattern based on its age rather than calendar dates. Use for businesses like restaurants, retail stores, subscription cohorts, or any asset that has a maturation curve. Examples: "I will open 1 restaurant in January, 2 in March, then 5 per year. Each restaurant generates $1000 in month 1, $2000 in month 2", "We'll launch new stores quarterly. Each store loses money for 6 months, then becomes profitable", "New subscription cohorts have different retention curves based on how long they've been customers".
