1)	Reconciliation tables: Any time you have a set of codes that starts with a code with a label like "Beginning" and ends with a label like "Ending", you are dealing with a "reconciliation table" and there are some standardized things to look out for. Go through each of the items below and look through every input driver in each reconciliation table to make sure these mistakes are not occurring:
a.	The beginning row should always reference the ending row below it. In the example below, <OFFSETCOLUMN-S; sumif="Offsetyear"; driver1="R2"; format="Volume"; indent="2"; bold="false"; topborder="false"; italic="true"; row1 = "V3|Beginning|||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";> references input driver R2, which is the output driver of the row labeled “Ending”. The encoder step commonly messes this up. Always verify that each ending row is linked to the driver of the beginning row. 
b.	The ending row should always be a SUM2-S code that references the beginning row of the table and the row directly above it. In the example, the row labeled “Ending” references the beginning row, which has an outputdriver of “V3” and the row labeled “Lost”, which has an output driver of R1 and is the row directly above the Ending row. Thus, the sum formula will sum all of the items from V3 to R1. <SUM2-S; driver1="V3"; driver2="R1"; bold="true"; topborder="true"; format="Volume"; indent="1"; italic="true"; sumif="Yearend"; row1 = "R2|Ending|0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";>. The encoder step commonly messes this up. Verify that driver1 and driver2 are at either ends of the range that needs to be summed. 
c.	There must not be any subtotals in between beginning and ending. 
d.	The sumif parameter for beginning should always be “offsetyear”
e.	The sumif parameter for ending should always be “yearend”
f.	The sumif parameter for the items in between should be “year”
g.	The negative parameter is very important. It is common for user/subs/etc. to upgrade from one reconciliation table to another. In this case, the table that is being upgraded from would show that number as negative and have negative=”true” and the table where they are upgrading to would show it as positive and would have negative=”false”.

Example of perfect reconciliation table: 
<LABELH1; row1 = "|Subscriptions:|||||||||||";>
<SPREAD-E; indent="1"; bold="true"; format="Volume"; topborder="false"; row1 = "V1|# of New Subscribers|||||10|10|10|10|10|10|";>
<SPREAD-E; indent="2"; bold="false"; format="Percent"; topborder="false"; row1 = "V2|% Churn/Year|||||.2|.2|.2|.2|.2|.2|";>
<BR; row1 = "||||||||||||";>
<LABELH3; row1 = "|# of Subscribers:|||||||||||";>
<OFFSETCOLUMN-S; sumif="Offsetyear"; driver1="R2"; format="Volume"; indent="2"; bold="false"; topborder="false"; italic="true"; row1 = "V3|Beginning|||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";>
<DIRECT-S; driver1="V1"; format="Volume"; indent="2"; bold="false"; topborder="false"; italic="true"; sumif="year"; row1 = "V4|New|||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";>
<MULT2-S; driver1="V3"; driver2="V2"; sumif="year"; format="Volume"; indent="2"; bold="false"; topborder="false"; negative="true"; italic="true"; row1 = "R1|Lost|0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";>
<SUM2-S; driver1="V3"; driver2="R1"; bold="true"; topborder="true"; format="Volume"; indent="1"; italic="true"; sumif="Yearend"; row1 = "R2|Ending|0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";>
<BR; row1 = "||||||||||||";>
<LABELH3; row1 = "|Subscription Revenue:|||||||||||";>
<CONST-E; format="DollarItalic"; indent="2"; bold="false"; topborder="false"; row1 = "V5|Price/Month/Subscriber|||||10|10|10|10|10|10|";>
<AVGMULT3-S; topborder="true"; bold="true"; indent="1"; format="Dollar"; driver1="V3"; driver2="R2"; driver3="V5"; row1 = "R3|Revenue - Subscription|IS: revenue||||F|F|F|F|F|F|";>
