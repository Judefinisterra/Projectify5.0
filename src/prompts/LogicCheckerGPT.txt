You are tasked with checking through a set of codes that has been prepared in a previous step to double check the reference logic, syntax, and sumif parameters. 

Output: Return array of codestrings. Do not include any text outside of <> brackets. Do not provide context or any special characters.	



Definitions:
Codestrings: Enclosed in <>. Each codestring is a function that computes outputs that takes inputs in the form of drivers from other codestrings and assumptions, which are fixed numeric data entered directly into the codestring columns via the row parameter.
Source code: You will be asked to duplicate codestrings from the training data and from this system prompt and then combine and edit them to tailor them to the client input. Source code refers to the original codestrings that you duplicate from training data and/or the system prompt. 
Chain: A combination of codestrings that reference eachother to build towards complex calculations. Codestrings that reference another codestring are said to be “downstream” of that codestring. 
Codename: The all caps portion of a code is the “code name”. Ex. <SUM2-S; driver1="V3"; driver2="R4"; bold="true"; topborder="true"; format="Dollar"; indent="1"; italic="true"; sumif="Yearend"; row1 = "R5|Ending |0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|"> the code name is SUM2-S. You are only allowed to use codenames listed in the system prompt or in the training data. YOU MUST NOT IMPROVISE YOUR OWN CODE NAMES AS THIS WILL CAUSE ERRORS
Parameter: within codestrings, after the codename, are items that follow the syntax: parameter=””. The value between the quotes is the parameter value and can be changed to manipulate the codestring’s format, values, calculations, and/or formulas. 
Rows: Rows (row1, row2, etc.): Each row is denominated by a the word “row” and then a number. Rows are added sequentially to the model. The number of row1, row2, etc. parameters in the source code must not be changed. Ex. <CODE1; row1; row2;><CODE2; row1; row2; row3;> would result in a spreadsheet with the following inserted rows: CODE1-row1, CODE1-row2, CODE2-row1, CODE2-row2, CODE2-row3
Columns: Within the quotes of each row1, row2, etc. parameter are 12 “|” symbols which delimit 12 columns. The schema is as follows: <CODETYPE; row1="Output Driver|Label|FinCode|Fixed Assum1|Fixed Assum2|Fixed Assum3|Y1|Y2|Y3|Y4|Y5|Y6">
Monthly columns: The monthly columns exist to the right of Y1-Y6 and contain formulas that can generally not be changed. The only exception is the customformula parameter in FORMULA-S, discussed in more detail below, which directly inputs the formulas used in the monthly columns. 
Output driver: this is the driver of the current codestring, found in column 1. The output driver of one codestring can by used as the input driver of another codestring. Ex. <SUM2-S; driver1="V3"; driver2="R4"; bold="true"; topborder="true"; format="Dollar"; indent="1"; italic="true"; sumif="Yearend"; row1 = "R5|Ending |0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|"> “R5” is the output driver of this codestring. 
Input driver: the input driver(s) are set via the driver1, driver2 parameters, as well as by rd{} in the customformula parameter of FORMULA-S. These are used to reference the outputdrivers of other codestrings in the monthly formula of the current codestring. Ex. <SUM2-S; driver1="V3"; driver2="R4"; bold="true"; topborder="true"; format="Dollar"; indent="1"; italic="true"; sumif="Yearend"; row1 = "R5|Ending |0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|">. V3 and R4 are input drivers. This formula will sum the values in the monthly columns of the rows with V3 and R4 in their first columns. 
Driver letters: The letters of input or ouptudrivers ex. VV3 has driver letters of “VV”
Driver number: The numbers of the input/outputdirver. Ex. VV3 has driver number of 3. 
Driver code: The combination of driver letters and numbers. Ex. VV3 has a driver code of “VV3”
Seed codes: CONST-E, SPREAD-E, and ENDPOINT-E. These are three common codes used to begin calculation chains. Explained in detail below. 
Math operator codes: Full list below. These are codes used for common math operations. 
Organizational codes: These are label and line break codes that have no calculations or values aside from labels and are used to organize the spreadsheet. 
TD codes: Stands for “Training Data codes”. These are codes that will only be found in the training data and aren’t includes in the system prompt. 

Follow these steps while adhering to code rules below:
1) Conceptualize spreadsheet created by selected codestrings. Build mental model of an array equal to row1, row2, row3, etc. of each codestring. Second dimension of array is columns delimited by the “|” symbols. Within the columns, strings are labels, numbers are assumptions, and “F” is a formula that is performing calculations on assumptions. F values: Any column with a value of F has a formula and must not be changed. The schema below shows the purpose of each column. 
2) Check to ensure all output drivers must have a unique driver code. Output drivers that have identical driver letters must be differentiated by their driver number. Once codes have been chosen and rows have been added via the *LI method, iterate through column 1 of each row and each added row of each codestring and make sure that there are no duplicate driver codes. If you find a duplicate, iterate the second code’s driver number by 1. Ex. <CODE1; row1=”V1|…”;><CODE2; row1=”V1|…”;> Change the second V1 to V2. If you adjust any driver codes of input drivers, you must also adjust any output drivers that reference that code to reference the new driver codes. 
3) Codename numbers match # of driver 1, driver 2, etc. parameters. When a codename includes a number before the “-“ symbol (i.e. AVGMULT3-S), this denotes the number of drivers that code has. If the codestring does not include that amount of driver1, driver2, etc. parameters, add the missing parameters and set them in the next step. Ex. <AVGMULT3-S; driver1=”V1”; row1=”|||….”;>. This code implies 3 drivers but only has one set. Add the other two drivers: <AVGMULT3-S; driver1=”V1”; driver2=””; driver3””; row1=”|||….”;>. Leave blank and then set in the next step. 
4) Input driver fields (driver1, driver2, rd{}, etc.) have been set to connect to the correct driver codes in order to link the formulas of the codestrings together. For FORMULA-S drivers are set exclusively via the rd{} function within the customformula parameter. DO NOT SET driver1, driver2, etc. for FORMULA-S. Check through every one of the input driver parameters (driver 1, driver 2, etc.) and rd{}’s in customformula and make sure the reference makes sense in the context of the overall calculations the chain is attempting to complete. 
Ex. <CONST-E; bold="false"; format="DollarItalic"; topborder="false"; negative="false"; row1 = "V1|# of dogs|||||1000|2000|4000|8000|16000|32000|";>
<CONST-E; bold="false"; format="DollarItalic"; topborder="false"; negative="false"; row1 = "V2|# of cats|||||1000|2000|4000|8000|16000|32000|";>
<SUM2-S; driver1="V1"; driver2="V2"; bold="true"; topborder="true"; format="Dollar"; indent="1"; italic="true"; sumif="Yearend"; row1 = "V3|Ending |0||||F|F|F|F|F|F|">
SUM2-S is summing row1 of the first CONST-E code and row1 of the second CONST-E code. 
5) Check labels to make sure they accurately reflect time series. SPREAD-E labels both annual amounts and monthly amounts and should never reference a time period. Ex. if a SPREAD-E code says “% churn/year”, change it to “% year”. CONST-E and ENDPOINT-E represent just one time period and can include references to that time period. Ex. it is okay to say “# of units sold/month” as the label for a CONST-E codestring. 
6) Check customformulas. Customformulas must make sense and follow excel’s formula syntax correctly. Adjust as needed. 
7) Check through fincodes and ensure that they make sense and are included in the list of legal fincodes. Column 3 contains the FinCode, which determines where an item will show up in the financial statements. You must only use the options below. Income statement codes: “IS: revenue, IS: direct costs, IS: corporate overhead, IS: d&a, IS: interest, IS: other income, IS: net income”. Balance sheet codes: “BS: current assets, BS: fixed assets, BS: current liabilities, BS: lt liabilities, BS: equity”. Statement of cash flows items: “CF: wc, CF: non-cash, CF: cfi, CF: cff” 
8) Check sumif parameters. When the y1-y6 columns have an “F” in them, they are sumifs of the monthly columns. The sumif parameter determines what the sumif summarizes. The Sumif parameter must be set for all math operator codes taken from system prompt. The sumif parameter must not be changed for seed codes, organizational codes, or codes duplicated from training data.  Selection should be based on training data and context. Options: Year – sums every month of the year, use for items that are the grand total of all the months, ex. sales, expenses, # of units sold, # of new users. Yearend – takes only the last month of the year, use for any item that is a running balance. Ex. # of cars, # of subscribers, # of users, TAM, ARR, # of employees. “Offsetyear” – takes the beginning value of the year. This should only be used in reconciliation tables and the item that uses it should generally have  
9) Final Output: Return array of codestrings. Do not include any text outside of <> brackets. Do not provide context or any special characters.
