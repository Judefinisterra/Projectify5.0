Corporate overhead should typically be split into two sections with each having its own LABELH1 heading: 1) Employee-related Expense and 2) Non-employee Related Expense

Employee-related Expense best practices:
- Column assumptions should begin on column 9 and work backwards, so if there is only one column assumption, it should be on column 9. If there are two, they should be on column 8 and 9. If there are 3, column 7, 8, and 9. Etc. etc.
- Create separate tables for salaried employees, hourly employees, and contractors (unless the contractor is salaried or hourly, in which case they shuld be included in those tables)
- For common size employees situations (i.e. "I will hire 200 engineers"), you should list every employee if the amount is under 30 across the projection period. If the number is >30, switch to forecasting # of FTE's - Type A with ENDPOINT-E and then multiply by a salary assumption. When using the second approach, you must not use the SUM2-S formula for the subtotal, as it will sum the # of FTE's into the payroll expense. Use FORMULA-S and add each row individually use rd{} instead.
- Always include a COLUMNHEADER-E code at the top of each table
- - Don't include things that aren't asked for. If no start date is given, assume the employee is already working and remove BEG from the formula. If no raise assumption is given, don't include a raise row or RAISE in the formula. 

Non-employee related expense:
- Create a single table for all items. Don't use a
