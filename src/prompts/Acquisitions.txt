# BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS MODELING GUIDANCE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING RULES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **üö® CASH FLOW TREATMENT:**
**ACQUISITION PRICE MUST ALWAYS BE REFLECTED IN CFI (Cash Flow from Investing) AS A NEGATIVE NUMBER.**

The cash paid to acquire another business represents a cash outflow for investing activities.

### **üö® DEFAULT GOODWILL TREATMENT:**
**DEFAULT TO CAPITALIZING THE ENTIRE ACQUISITION PRICE AS GOODWILL WITH NO AMORTIZATION.**

Use ACCUM-S code linked to an acquisition consideration driver to record the acquisition price as Goodwill on the balance sheet.

## BASIC IMPLEMENTATION

### **Standard Structure:**
```
**(FORMULA-S code for one-time acuisition price on the close date. row1 has V1)**
<ACCUM-S; driver1="V1"; row1="V2(D)|Goodwill - Acquisition(L)|is: fixed assets(F)|CF: CFI(F)">
```

**Key Elements:**

- **ACCUM-S**: Links goodwill to acquisition consideration driver
- **Goodwill fincode**: Properly classifies as intangible asset
- **CF: CFI**: Ensures proper cash flow statement classification as negative investing activity
- **No Amortization**: Goodwill does not depreciate over time

## TARGET COMPANY FINANCIALS

### **Standalone Financial Modeling:**
**TARGET FINANCIALS SHOULD BE MODELED ON A STANDALONE BASIS WITH NO ADJUSTMENT FOR THE CLOSE DATE.**

Model the target company's revenue, expenses, and other financial items as if they operate independently, without considering when the acquisition closes. These standalone items should have **NO FINCODES**.

### **Acquisition-Adjusted Integration:**
**CREATE A SEPARATE SECTION THAT MODELS THOSE ITEMS 0'D OUT UNTIL THE CLOSE DATE.**

Use BEG(close_date) function with the close date driver from the acquisition cost row to include target financials only after acquisition. Apply appropriate fincodes to these integration items.

### **Structure Example:**
```
<!-- Standalone Target Financials (no fincodes) -->
<SPREAD-E; row1="V3(D)|Target Company Revenue - Standalone(L)|100000|105000|110000|...">
<SPREAD-E; row1="V4(D)|Target Company Expenses - Standalone(L)|60000|62000|65000|...">

<!-- Acquisition-Adjusted Integration (with fincodes) -->
<FORMULA-S; row1="V5(D)|Target Company Revenue - Post Acquisition(L)|is: revenue(F)|V3*BEG([close_month])">
<FORMULA-S; row1="V6(D)|Target Company Expenses - Post Acquisition(L)|is: expense(F)|V4*BEG([close_month])">
```

**Key Points:**
- **Standalone**: No fincodes, models target as independent entity
- **Integration**: Uses BEG function to start inclusion from close date
- **Fincodes**: Only applied to integration items that affect consolidated financials
- **Close Date**: References the same timing as acquisition consideration driver
