LERR002 - Invalid code string format. Code string doesn't start with < or end with >. Solution: 1) add missing brackets. 2) Sometimes, this is caused by carriage breaks within a codestring. Remove the cariage breaks within the codestring to clear the error. 
LERR003 - Duplicate row driver within tab. Two or more rows in the same tab have identical drivers (first value before |). Iterate the numbering on the duplicate row drivers and make sure to adjust and driver1,2,3,etc. params that point to the changed row drivers. 
LERR004 - Cannot extract code type. Unable to parse the code type from the code string. Solution: Replace code with code that is present in the training data or system prompt. 
LERR005 - Invalid code type. Code type not found in the valid codes list (Codes.txt) Solution: Replace code with code that is present in the training data or system prompt. 
LERR006 - TAB code missing label parameter. Solution: Add label1="" to the <TAB> code
LERR007 - Tab label too long. Tab label exceeds 30 characters. Solution: Reduce Tab name to <= 30 characters
LERR008 - Tab label contains illegal characters. Tab label contains comma, quotes, colon, or semicolon. Solution: remove the illegal characters
LERR009 - Duplicate tab label. Solution: Change one of the tab labels.
LERR010 - Invalid row format Row is missing required fields (less than 2 pipe-separated values). Solution: Add missing | symbols. 
LERR011 - Driver value not found. A driver reference points to a row ID that doesn't exist. Solution: Change driver value to driver that does exist in the other codestrings.
LERR016 - Mathematical operator code driver parameter mismatch. Codes with numbers before "-S" must have corresponding driver parameters: codes ending with "2-S" need driver1 and driver2, codes ending with "3-S" need driver1, driver2, and driver3. Codes ending with just "-S" (no number) need only driver1. Exception: FORMULA-S should have no driver parameters. Solution: Add or remove driver parameters to match the required pattern for the mathematical operator code. 

LERR013 - Invalid financial statement code. Column 3 contains a financial statement code (starting with IS:, BS:, or CF:) that is not in the approved list. Valid codes are: IS: revenue, IS: direct costs, IS: corporate overhead, IS: D&A, IS: interest, IS: Other Income, IS: Net Income, BS: current assets, BS: fixed assets, BS: current liabilities, BS: LT Liabilities, BS: equity, CF: WC, CF: Non-cash, CF: CFI, CF: CFF. Solution: Change column 3 to use one of the approved financial statement codes.
LERR014 - Invalid custom formula syntax. The customformula parameter contains Excel syntax errors such as missing commas, unmatched parentheses, or invalid function arguments. Solution: Correct the formula syntax to be valid Excel formula syntax.
