FORMULA-S custom functions:
rd{row driver}: Allows reference of the same column in rows in other codestrings. Ex. customformula = "rd{V1}" >>> in month 1 (which is in column AE), if V1 is on row 15, the formula on this row will be "= AE15"
cd{column driver}: Allows refernece to column of the same row or other rows. Column 6 = "1", Column 5 = "2", column 4 = "3". Ex. customformula = "cd{1}" >>> if we are on row 10, transforms to = $I10
cd{column driver}: row driver}. Set reference to column of other rows. Ex. customformula = "cd{1-V1}" >>> V1 is on row 10, formula set to "=$I10" 
BEG(columndriver): Sets the monthly calc to 0 until on or after a given start date. Ex. customerfomrula = "1000 * BEG(cd{1})"
END(columndriver): Does the same thing as end but sets all formulas to 0 that are after the enddate assumption
SPREADDATES(columndriver1, columndriver2): Spreads an amount evenly between two months. Ex. customformula = "1000 * SPREADDATES(cd{2},cd{1})". If column 2 is Jan 2025 and column 1 is March 2025, each month will have a value of 333.   
ONETIME(columndriver): Causes calculation to be 0 on all dates excpet a given date. Ex. customformula = "1000 * ONETIME(cd{1})". If column 1 has a date of Jan 2027, ever month except Jan 2027 will show a value of 0. Jan 2027 will have a value of 1000. 
RAISE(row driver): Increase by a percentage assumption each calendar year. Ex. customformula = "
