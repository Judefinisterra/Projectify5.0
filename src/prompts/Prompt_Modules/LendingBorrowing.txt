# LENDING & BORROWING MODELING GUIDE

## WHEN TO USE SIMPLE DEBT CODES

Use standard debt codes for **uniform, predictable debt structures** where all loans follow the same pattern:

### Simple Debt Code Types:
- **DAMORT**: Amortizing debt (with down payment/origination)
- **LAMORT**: Amortizing debt (loan-style)
- **DBULLET**: Bullet/balloon payment debt (with down payment)
- **LBULLET**: Bullet/balloon payment debt (loan-style)

### Examples of Simple Debt:
✅ **Use Simple Codes**: "I will originate 10 loans per month for $1000 each. They amortize over 24 months and have 5% interest."
✅ **Use Simple Codes**: "We issue $50K of bonds annually. They mature in 5 years with 4% interest paid quarterly."
✅ **Use Simple Codes**: "Monthly equipment financing of $25K, repaid over 36 months at 6% APR."

## WHEN TO USE INDEX GROWTH CURVE FOR DEBT

Use INDEX system for **complex, custom debt structures** where individual loans have unique repayment patterns:

### Complex Debt Characteristics:
- Non-standard repayment schedules
- Multiple payment milestones
- Variable payment amounts
- Age-dependent payment patterns
- Custom amortization curves

### Examples Requiring INDEX Approach:
❌ **Don't Use Simple Codes**: "I borrow 10 loans a month. Each is for $1000. They are repaid in 2 payments: 50% in month 12, 50% in month 24."
❌ **Don't Use Simple Codes**: "We originate mortgages with custom schedules: 10% down, interest-only for 12 months, then principal + interest for remaining term."
❌ **Don't Use Simple Codes**: "Equipment loans have maintenance payments: $500 monthly for months 1-6, then $1000 monthly for months 7-24."

## INDEX APPROACH FOR COMPLEX DEBT

### Structure for Complex Debt:
```
<SPREAD-E; row1="V1(D)|# of New Loans per Month(L)|...">

<INDEXBEGIN; driver1="V1"; row1="...">
  <CONST-E; row1="V2(D)|Loan Principal(L)|is: liability(F)|...">
  <FORMULA-S; row1="A1(D)|Principal Payment Month 12(L)|is: liability(F)|cd{6-V2}*onetimeindex(12)">
  <FORMULA-S; row1="A2(D)|Principal Payment Month 24(L)|is: liability(F)|cd{6-V2}*onetimeindex(24)">
  <FORMULA-S; row1="A3(D)|Interest Expense(L)|is: interest expense(F)|-cd{6-V3}/12*average(rd{V2},rd{A4})">
<INDEXEND>
```

### Key INDEX Debt Components:
1. **Volume Driver**: Number of new loans per period
2. **Principal**: Initial loan amount using CONST-E
3. **Custom Payments**: Use FORMULA-S with ONETIMEINDEX() for specific payment dates
4. **Interest Calculations**: Use FORMULA-S with rd{} references for complex interest logic
5. **Self-Containment**: All debt logic must be within INDEX block

## DECISION FLOWCHART

```
Does the debt have uniform repayment terms?
├── YES → Are all loans identical in structure?
│   ├── YES → Use Simple Debt Codes (DAMORT, LAMORT, DBULLET, LBULLET)
│   └── NO → Use INDEX Growth Curve
└── NO → Use INDEX Growth Curve
```

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### For Simple Debt Codes:
✓ All loans have identical terms
✓ Standard amortization or bullet structure
✓ No custom payment schedules
✓ Uses appropriate D/L prefix (D=down payment, L=loan)

### For INDEX Debt Systems:
✓ Volume driver exists for loan origination
✓ Custom payment logic uses ONETIMEINDEX() functions
✓ Interest calculations reference loan balances correctly
✓ All debt components are self-contained within INDEX
✓ Principal and payment flows have proper fincodes

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Wrong**: Using simple codes for non-uniform repayment schedules
❌ **Wrong**: Mixing simple debt codes with INDEX approach for same loan type
❌ **Wrong**: External references to INDEX debt drivers
❌ **Wrong**: Missing fincodes on principal and payment flows
✅ **Correct**: Choose one approach per debt type and stick with it
✅ **Correct**: Use INDEX for any custom or complex repayment logic
✅ **Correct**: Ensure all debt components flow to appropriate financial statement sections
